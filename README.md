# Master's Thesis: Resource Collector Simulation

This project is being developed for a Master's thesis that studies the implementation of behaviours in subjects using Machine Learning. The Resource Collector project attempts to simulate the behaviour of "workers" tasked with collecting resources from their surroundings and bringing them to a centralized location. 

The environment will have multiple targets to represent different kinds of resources, a goal to bring the resources known as the "resource depot", and at least two agents.

# Unity ML-Agents SDK

The project uses Unity ML-Agents to train agents.

# Goals

The following are the goals of this project:

- [ ] 1 Agent: collecting a resource and bringing it to the goal
- [ ] 1 Agent: collecting multiple resources ...
- [ ] 2 Agents: collecting multiple resources ...
- [ ] 2 Agents: collecting multiple resources in a specific order ...
